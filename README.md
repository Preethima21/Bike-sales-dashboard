Creating a bike sales dashboard in Excel with the specified components involves visualizing data related to average income per purchase, customer age brackets, and customer commute. Here are the steps to create such a dashboard:

1. Average Income per Purchase:
- Calculate the average income for each purchase transaction.
- Create a table or chart to visualize the distribution of income per purchase.

2. Customer Age Brackets:
- Group customers into different age brackets (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, etc.).
- Count the number of customers in each age bracket.
- Visualize the distribution of customers across age brackets using a bar chart or pie chart.

3. Customer Commute:
- Determine how customers commute to the store (e.g., bike, car, public transportation).
- Count the number of customers using each commuting method.
- Visualize the distribution of customer commute methods using a bar chart or pie chart.
